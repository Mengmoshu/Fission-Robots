# Fission Robots
Construction and Logistics bots that never run out of power. As a bonus they're a little faster, and stack to 100 instead of 50. Inspired by (and currently borrowing art from) the Fusion Robots mod.

I haven't spent time fine tuning the recipe or research costs, I banged this out in an evening. I also need to replace the graphics, which I plan to do by programmatically tinting (or otherwise tweaking) the vanilla graphics for Construction and Logistics bots.
